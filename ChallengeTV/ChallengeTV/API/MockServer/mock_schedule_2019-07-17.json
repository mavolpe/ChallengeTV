One of the major differences between network news and the PBS NewsHour is that because the show is publicly funded, there are no commercials. This allows the NewsHour to dedicate more time to comprehensive reporting.</p>",

The film reconstructs the story, beginning with the early-morning discovery of the murders, charting the initial missteps by local police, the hurried transfer of the case to India's Central Bureau of Investigation, the use of dubious interrogation techniques, the sensational criminal trial and the multiple legal appeals.

            "summary": "<p>Stephen Colbert takes over as host of The Late Show on Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2015. Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and lest known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed The Colbert Report, which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koÊŠlËˆbÉ›É™r, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time. Good luck, Bill!</p>",
