Oxygen's hit true crime series, <i>Snapped</i>, profiles the fascinating cases of women accused of murder. Did they really do it? And, if they did, why? Whether the motivation was revenge against a cheating husband, the promise of a hefty insurance payoff, or putting an end to years of abuse, the reasons are as varied as the women themselves. From socialites to secretaries, female killers share one thing in common: at some point, they all snapped. <b>Snapped </b>is produced in conjunction with Jupiter Entertainment, the creators of <i>City Confidential</i> and <i>Dominick Dunne's Power</i>, <i>Privilege &amp; Justice</i>, and narrated by veteran news reporter Sharon Martin. Each episode of <i>Snapped</i> chronicles the life of a woman who has been charged with murder. These shocking but true stories turn common assumptions about crime and criminals upside down, and prove that even the most unlikely suspects can be capable of murder.</p>",

In a town where entry is granted only through class, pedigree, and lineage, how far will these ladies go to secure their spot at the top of this prestigious circle?</p>",

From the tallest pyramids to an underwater city, experts take viewers on an unforgettable journey.</p><p>Unearthed fuses elements of engineering, history, geology, and archaeology, revealing the deepest secrets of each structure. We'll see the latest technology used to solve mysteries such as how the Parthenon still stands against earthquakes; how sticky rice was used to build the Great Wall of China; and what sacred secret lies beneath the Mayan temples of Chichen Itza.</p><p>They may be older structures, but scientists and archaeologists use the latest technology including LiDAR scanning, X-ray imaging, carbon dating, and 3D printing techniques to reveal secrets of the past in ways that weren't possible before. Unearthed shows the future of science and technology are key to understanding our past, and without these developments, we wouldn't be able to unravel some of the world's greatest mysteries.</p>",

Told through multiple points of view, the limited series aims to shed light on the psychology that drives the political process from the top down.</p>",
