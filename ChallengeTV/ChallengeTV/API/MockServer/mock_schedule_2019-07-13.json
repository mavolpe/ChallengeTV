            "summary": "<p><b>TMZ </b>(also known simply as <i>TMZ</i> or <i>TMZTV or TMZ on TV</i>) is an American syndicated entertainment and gossip news television show that premiered on September 10, 2007. The program is generally aired on Fox, CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates (along with a few affiliates of other major networks), though a majority of the stations that carry the series are Fox affiliates. It is essentially a television version of its sister operation, TMZ.com, a news website with a heavy emphasis on gossip of celebrities' personal lives, which debuted in December 2005. The television program is produced at studio facilities that serve as the headquarters for the parent website, located at 13031 West Jefferson Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. TMZ is an insider term (\"thirty-mile zone\" or studio zone), referring to the movie studio area of downtown Hollywood. On October 23, 2013, Warner Bros. Television Distribution announced that the program's charter station group, FOX Television Stations, renewed <i>TMZ on TV</i> through the 2016â€“17 season.</p>",

The show has often satirized pop culture, and made itself easier for parents to watch along too. And thus, the positive impact this show has had on modern society is beyond another. No show is more recognized the world over by as many generations and walks of life. Shown in its original format or with changes to reflect a regional education focus, Sesame Street is now seen in over 140 countries.

            "summary": "<p><b>UFC Fight Night</b> is a part of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) which is the largest mixed martial arts promotion company in the world featuring most of the top-ranked fighters in the sport. Based in the United States, the UFC produces events worldwide. The organization showcases nine weight divisions and abides by the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. The UFC has held over 300 events to date. Dana White serves as the president of the UFC while brothers Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta control the UFC's parent company, Zuffa, LLC. The first UFC event was held on November 12, 1993 at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado. The purpose of the early UFC competitions was to identify the most effective martial art in a real fight between competitors of different fighting disciplines, including boxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Sambo, wrestling, Muay Thai, karate, judo, and other styles. In subsequent competitions, fighters began adopting effective techniques from more than one discipline, which indirectly helped create an entirely separate style of fighting known as present-day mixed martial arts.</p>",

Shakespeare was right but unfortunately it's not just foolish acts that love can inspire, but murderous ones too. From the couple that breaks religious traditions for love, to the priest who has fallen for a nun, each episode of this true crime drama centres on star-crossed lovers who have defied the forces trying to keep them apart. But once they've crossed that line, anything can happen on Investigation Discovery's newest docu-drama <b>Forbidden: Dying for Love</b>. Among the forbidden tales uncovered in this series is the single mum whose 18-month jail sentence led to a passionate relationship with a prison guard. But when she vows to leave him, will he let her go? When a strict father who forbids relationships discovers his 15-year-old daughter plans to run away with her boyfriend of four years, will he follow through on his vow to kill her? And when a single mum's new fiance asks her to kill his ex-wife and children, will she accept his sinister proposal in the fear her family could be next? Anything is possible in the name of love. Especially when that love is forbidden.</p>",
